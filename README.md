# Orbital Plane Change Δv Calculator
Calculate orbital plane change with Δv cost

## Getting Started
These instruction will help you get the calculator up and running on your Windows machine. 

### Prerequisites

```
.NET Framework 4.7.2
```
You can download it here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472

### Build
To build the program, open the solution using Visual Studio and build it using .NET Framework 4.7.2.<br>

### Run the program
The only current way to run the program is to build it yourself. <br>
An executable file <b>will</b> be added to make things easier for those who do not wish to build the software themselves.


### Coding style
Documentation is added to functions and methods by using Visual Studio default style
```
/// <summary>
/// Calculates velocity at periapsis in m/s
/// </summary>
/// <param name="apa">Apoapsis</param>
/// <param name="pea">Periapsis</param>
/// <returns>Velocity</returns>
public double CalcPeAVelocity (double apa, double pea) {
```
